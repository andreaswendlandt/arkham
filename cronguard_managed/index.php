<h1>Cronguard</h1> 
<h2>- Let your Cronjobs get evaluated -</h2>

<h3>#What it is</h3>
<h3>#How it works</h3>
<h3>#What do i need</h3>
Only 2 things, the script cron_wrapper.sh which executes your cronjobs and a valid token <br />
you can get both on this site, the cron_wrapper.sh script from the download section,<br />
the token you can generate at the generate token section(all you need for that is a valid email address)<br />
<h3>#What does it cost</h3>
NOTHING, using this service is absolutely and 100% for free! <br />
If you have a bad conscience about not paying for it - please support your local animal shelter.
